# DiskSpaceApplication

Given a Integer() used, representing the amount of disk space used on each drive, and a corresponding Integer() total, representing 
the total capacity of each drive mentioned in used, you should attempt to pack the data onto as few hard drives as possible. You may assume that the 
data consists of very small files, such that splitting it up and moving parts of it onto different hard drives never presents a problem. Return the minimum number
of hard drives that still contain data after the consolidation is complete.
